# Component Library

Welcome to the component library documentation. This library contains 55+ UI components built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

All components are located in `src/components/ui/` and can be imported directly:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

## Available Components

Browse the sidebar to see all available components. Each component page includes:

- Usage examples
- Props documentation
- Code snippets
- TypeScript types

## Installation

Components are already included in this project. No additional installation needed!

## Styling

All components use Tailwind CSS v4 and support dark mode. Theme variables are configured in `src/index.css`.
