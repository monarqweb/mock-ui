# Faq

Renders a FAQ section with accordion-style questions and answers.

## Purpose

This component displays frequently asked questions organized by category (General and Billing).
It uses accordion components to allow users to expand and collapse questions to view answers.
The layout is responsive with a grid structure that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Demo

```tsx demo
import { Faq } from '@/components/blocks/spike/faq';

export function Demo() {
  return (
    <Faq />
  )
}
```
