# Taxonomy

The taxonomy system provides a structured way to identify and categorize components, enabling AI agents to properly understand and select the right components for specific use cases.

## Purpose

The taxonomy serves as a classification framework that helps AI agents:
- **Identify components** based on their characteristics and use cases
- **Match components** to specific requirements and contexts
- **Understand relationships** between different component attributes
- **Make informed decisions** when suggesting or selecting components

Each component is tagged with taxonomy values that describe its category, target industry, intended purpose, and stylistic tone.

## Taxonomy Types

The taxonomy system consists of four distinct taxonomies:

### Category

Category describes a component based on its content and how it's used. These are large groupings that do not reflect their intent, tone, or industry.

### Industry

Industry is an optional tag that can be given to components that have content, features, or functions related to a specific industry. Only tag an industry when the component's structure, props, or default semantics assume that industry.

### Intent

Intent describes the primary outcome the component is trying to achieve. It does not describe visual style. Intent should be stable over time.

### Tone

Tone describes the emotional posture of a component. It does not describe brand adjectives or visuals since those can vary by site. Tone is orthogonal to intent—a conversion component can be calm or aggressive.
